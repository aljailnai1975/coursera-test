        Step 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).<br>
        Step 2Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.<br>
        Step 3 Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.<br>
        Step 4 While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.<br>
        Step 5 Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.<br>
        Step 6 Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.<br></span></div>

        <div id="beef"><p id="bold">Beef</p><span>This is a Beef receipe:<br>
        In a large dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add beef and cook until seared on all sides, 10 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Transfer beef to a plate. <br>
        In the same pot, cook onion, carrots, and celery until soft, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add garlic and tomato paste and cook until garlic is fragrant and tomato paste has darkened, 2 minutes. <br>
        Add beef back to dutch oven then add broth, wine, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and bay leaves. <br>
        Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let simmer until beef is tender, 30 to 45 minutes.<br>
        Add potatoes and simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender, 15 minutes. <br>
        Remove bay leaves. Stir in peas and cook until warmed through, 2 minutes. Season stew to taste with salt and pepper, then ladle into serving bowls and garish with parsley. .<br></span></div>

      <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <div id="shushi"><p id="bold">Shushi</p><span>This is a Shushi receipe:<br>
        1. Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on Amazon) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.<br>
        2. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. (See below for more about making perfect sushi rice.)
        Don't use too much rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for how much rice to use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per whole sheet of nori, leaving a small space at the top edge of the nori so you can seal up the roll.<br>
        PRO TIP: Wet your fingers as you spread the sticky sushi rice over the nori.<br>
        3. Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside, simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat. Then add your ingredients to the top of the nori.<br>
        4. Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi. Press and shape the ingredients into a tube. Roll with pressure so you get a firm roll.<br>
        5. Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top. Seal the edge of the nori with a little cold water. Firm it up by squeezing the mat around the roll until it feels uniformly snug. Be careful not to squeeze so hard that the ingredients are smashed or come oozing out the sides. It's a fine line; with practice you'll get the feel of it.<br>
        6. Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting board. Then cut each half into thirds -- so you have 6 pieces of sushi. To get a nice clean cut, wet the knife with water each time you make a slice.<br>
        7. Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates. Enjoy with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger, and a little chopped daikon if you like.<br>
